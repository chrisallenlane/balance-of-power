Todo:
  - Radius: account for tile traversal cost
  - Radius: create an enum mapping tiles to movement cost
  - Radius: implement firing solution
  - Movement: update "passable" (can't pass through, vs can't place on)

  - Animation: make cursor/camera movement smooth
  - Animation: map tiles (rivers, grass)
  - Art: make units smaller?
  - Config: add config (debug)
  - Movement: path arrow (with different color marker for impassible)
  - Movement: unit movement radius
  - SFX: stub

Tooling:
  - Implement unit-tests
  - Implement benchmarking harness

Etc:
  - Add a LICENSE
  - Update the README
